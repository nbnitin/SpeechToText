# SpeechToTextUsage Guidelines
While they aren’t yet clearly defined, Apple has provided some usage guidelines for Speech Recognition. Apple will be enforcing the following types of limitations:

Per device per day
Per app per day (global limitations for all users of your app)
One minute limitation for a single utterance (from start to end of a recognition task)
Apple hasn’t provided any numbers for device and app daily limits. These rules are likely to mature and become more concrete as Apple sees how third party developers use the framework.

Apple also emphasizes that you must make it very clear to users when they are being recorded. While it isn’t currently in the review guidelines, it’s in your best interest to follow this closely to avoid rejections. You also wouldn’t want to invade your user’s privacy!

Finally, Apple suggests presenting transcription results before acting on them. Sending a text message via Siri is a great example of this: she’ll present editable transcription results and delay before sending the message. Transcription is certainly not perfect, and you want to protect users from the frustration and possible embarrassment of mistakes.

Apple limits recognition per device. The limit is not known, but you can contact Apple for more information.
Apple limits recognition per app.

If you routinely hit limits, make sure to contact Apple, they can probably resolve it.

Speech recognition uses a lot of power and data.

Speech recognition only lasts about a minute at a time.
